time of 00:00 takes it from the logical expression.
time is the amount of time after the event has fired.
the time is joined to the logical expression of the alarm with OR not AND.

Simulator reruns the roast virtually to what happened at that time in the roast.
- Asks for the alog file first.
- all output variables are shown on the right and are exactly as they were during the roast no matter what you do.
- runs the events and manual changes like up burner 10--taking the slider down a number means take burner down that number. In the simulation, it will apply the delta, not the value.
- it marks the automated events as they happened unless you change the charge event time to be sooner, or other criteria not yet explored.
- There is a lot of stuff that happens before charge in a profile that is simulated in the simulator.
- You can press all the buttons as you would during a roast.
- All alarms are simulated.
- The simulation can be used to make a new profile.

Once an alarm is greyed out, cannot get it to rerun.
